Coaching rules:
- Keep the total effort inside the daily time budget.
- Weight higher-importance fundamentals more heavily, but avoid monotony.
- Include at most the configured max items; respect per-group limits.
- Prefer tasks not done in the last N days unless critical.
- When user struggled (low difficulty scores), resurface related items with supportive reasoning.
- Difficulty scale is 1 (very easy) to 5 (very hard).
- Summaries should be short and actionable.
- Coach feedback tasks are allowed (ai_conversation, external_link, reflection, movement).
